# Coding tasks
- [ ] Check status of harmony jobs
- [ ] Obtain urls for harmony jobs using download_atl09/harmony-urls/get_job_urls
- [ ] Identify new icecaps gws location, update all:
    + [ ] scripts
    + [ ] slurm submission scripts
    + [ ] ICECAPS environement variable
    + [ ] notebooks
- [ ] Identify storage capacity requirements for new ATL09 data, and check with Neely if this flies
- [ ] Compress old ATL09 data for all sites, delete if necessary
- [ ] Initialise downloads for harmony jobs on nxfer servers into appropriate folders on new gws

- [ ] Write new index function for larger R values being sampled
- [ ] Update memory requirements and array indices for vcfs_per_event slurm submission
- [ ] Implement the proper Cloudnet quality checks
- [ ] Re-run get collocation events
- [ ] Re-run vcfs_per_event
- [ ] Re-run both MI scripts (histogram and holmes)

- [ ] Implement a basic validation routine, that can run on vcfs_per_event
- [ ] Run validation script on all vcfs_per_event
- [ ] Plot of representative statistic forall R, tau
- [ ] For select p in {p00, p01, p10, p11, p_typical, p_maxMIhist, p_maxMIholmes}, plot more validation quantities and describe how results change with changing p.
- [ ] Bish bash bosh bobs your uncle




# Figures for paper
- [ ] Figure 3
Shows off the collocation and homogenisation processing.
\caption {
    (a) The ATL09 strong beam ground track trajectories relative to Ny-Alesund, for the ATL09 orbit with RGT <RGT> on cycle <cycle>.
    The raw ATL09 data (b) and the caclculated collocation criteria (c).
    The vertical red lines indicate the boundaries of the subset data that is included after collocation.
    The cloud mask for Cloudnet (d) and corresponding collocation criteria (e), similar to (b) and (c) respectively.
    (f) The homogenised vertical cloud fractions from the collocated ATL09 and Cloudnet data.

    + [ ] Decide on a particular case study
    + [ ] Adapt plot in `test_CollocationEventList.ipynb`, to include homogenised data on right
    + [ ] Further adapt plot to display un-subset data, and highlight data kept after subsetting

Results of analysis at a given site across range of R, tau values.
\caption {
    For a range of parametrisations (R, tau), the total number of collocation events (a) and profiles within the collocated events (b) being used in the analysis.
    For the given parametrisations, the mutual information between the ATL09 and Cloudnet vertical cloud fraction profiles using the histogram (c) and holmes et al. (2019) (d) mutual information estimators.

    + [ ] Adapt figure from LOCAL `_MI_data/basic_plots.ipynb`
    + [ ] Select a site
    + [ ] Recreate the plot for larger range of R, tau
    + [ ] Include subplot labels in inkscape
